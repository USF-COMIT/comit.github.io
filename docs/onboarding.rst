Step 3: Turn on 2 Factor Authentication
---------------------------------------

2 Factor authentication adds an extra layer of security both to your own account and the COMIT group account.   You are highly encouraged to enable it.

.. Warning::
    If you want permissions to create repositories, manage repositories, and/or manage the COMIT GitHub group you will need to enable 2 factor authentication.
